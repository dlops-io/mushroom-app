        # source: https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate#postgresql
        # Dbmate is a database migration tool, to keep your database schema in sync across multiple developers and your production servers
        # keeps track of migrations, and runs it in an order; the power of dbmate is to manage migrations of the script; Shivas uses DataGrip to manage; “dbmate rollback” removes stuff; “dbmate up” creates the table; When we run this “sh ./docker-shell.sh”, I can get the same database setup as Shivas on his end
